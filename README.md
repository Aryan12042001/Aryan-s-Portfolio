## [Heart Disease Prediction Using Genetic Algorithms and Ensemble Learning](https://github.com/Aryan12042001/4830_Project)

**Project Overview:** Developed an advanced predictive model for heart disease using Genetic Algorithms (GA) for feature selection and Ensemble Learning methods. The project aimed to enhance prediction accuracy by optimizing feature subsets and combining multiple models.

**Key Techniques:**
- **Feature Selection:** Employed GA to identify the most relevant features.
- **Ensemble Methods:** Used Stacked Generalization with base models including Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest, and a meta-model (AdaBoostClassifier).
- **Evaluation:** Applied K-Fold Cross-Validation and assessed models using accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.

**Outcome:** The Stacked Genetic Algorithm model demonstrated superior performance with high accuracy and robustness, outperforming individual models and various feature sets.
